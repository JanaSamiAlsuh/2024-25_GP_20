This project leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and AI-driven text analysis, offering a powerful solution for users handling Arabic data. 




## Technologies 
The system is developed using **Python** for development to handle the backend processes, including tracking real-time data. It will use location-based services to monitor user movements and update system statuses accordingly. The platform will also estimate wait times for users in case resources are limited, providing a seamless experience for managing tasks efficiently
